## workout template creator for the famous strength training program 5/3/1 - work in progress
Once this script is finished, it will prompt the user to enter his preferences for the many workout templates in the 5/3/1 training method. The user will get an Excel sheet as final output.
The motivation for this projects stems from my many many attempts to build a comprehensive 5/3/1 Excel sheet, which were usually fine and did an okay-job at providing a training sheet with weights and repetitions, but ultimately I want an automatized process and a full library of all templates with all their variations.
